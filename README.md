### Welcome to PandaSQL
PandaSQL is a lightweight embedded RDBMS written in C++. Please check [Wiki](https://github.com/tianzhou/PandaSQL/wiki) for implementation details.

### Motivation
After having been reading quite a few literatures and open source projects, the author just can't keep waiting to build a mini one himself in order to advance his database understanding/coding skill to the next level.

### Author
My name is [Tianzhou Chen (陈天舟)](http://drawrect.com). My day job is a database kernel engineer. While the work is quite challenge and fun, I still can't resist the temptation to implement a database from scratch by myself, which is not possible to be fulfilled by my job.

### Disclaimer
This is just my hobby project, it has no affiliation with any other parties.
