My day job is a database kernel engineer. While the work is quite challenge and fun, I still can't resist the temptation to implement a database from scratch by myself, which is not possible to be fulfilled by my job.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nThis is just my hobby project, it has no affiliation with any other parties.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
