Please check [Wiki](https://github.com/tianzhou/PandaSQL/wiki) for implementation details.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nAfter having been reading quite a few literatures and open source projects, the author just can't keep waiting to build a mini one himself in order to advance his database understanding/coding skill to the next level.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nMy name is [Tianzhou Chen (陈天舟)](http://drawrect.com). My day job is a database kernel engineer. While the work is quite challenge and fun, I still can't resist the temptation to implement a database from scratch by myself, which is not possible to be fulfilled by my job.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nThis is just my hobby project, it has no affiliation with any other parties.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
